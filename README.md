# FFH 

### Repository for past work surrounding the Fission-Fusion Project in ReTI

* JoeyEickman handover files (rootCase files, original scripts)

* OpenMC2GF MGXS scripts



### Notes:

* When using original handover rootCases, there are some edits required. Namely, the reactorState file is in the constant directory rather than in 0/uniform as is required by current versions of GeN-Foam
