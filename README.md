### Repository for past work surrounding the Fission-Fusion Project in ReTI

* JoeyEickman handover files (rootCase files, original scripts)

* OpenMC2GF MGXS and Source Mapping scripts

### Notes:

* When using original handover rootCases, there are some edits required. Namely, the reactorState file is in the constant directory rather than in 0/uniform as is required by current versions of GeN-Foam

* Source mapping scripts are based on the [openmc-src-mesh-mapping](https://github.com/pshriwise/openmc-src-mesh-mapping) script made by MN and pshriwise (also forked by NybergWISC [here](https://github.com/NybergWISC/openmc-src-mesh-mapping))
